We propose a LATAM NIME Research Network, with which we aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-termed actionable initiatives that the network and the community could explore in the near future. Some of these actions include:

* **Establishing a LATAM NIME Network:**
  * Building stronger ties through multiple communication platforms \(e.g., a mailing list, a Discord Server, a Slack Workspace, a Telegram/WhatsApp group, a wiki, a forum, etc.\)
  * Developing LATAM NIME pedagogies
  * Organising mentorship programmes
* **Exploring LATAM NIME Perspectives:**

  * Decolonising NIME research
  * Making NIME researcher more affordable and resourceful

  ​

* **Thinking of Next Steps for LATAM NIME:**
  * Hosting more NIMEs in LATAM
  * Organising Local NIME Chapters and Hubs in LATAM \(As well as organising regular local and remote events\)
  * Writing NIME Papers in the Languages of LATAM
