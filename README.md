# About

Historically, Latin America \(LATAM\) has produced many musics that have resonated around the world. Equally, it has also significantly contributed and continues to contribute to the field of New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) \[1\]. Yet, the NIME conference has only been hosted in LATAM once in 2019 at Porto Alegre, Brazil, where only 18 publications out of 88 were from LATAM authors and co-authors \[2\], and authors affiliated to LATAM institutions represent only 2.4% of the total amount of participants of the first 20 NIME Conference editions \(from 2001 to 2020\) \[3\]. 

We look forward to taking the first steps towards a LATAM NIME Community and the future of this community within and beyond NIME, opening to other communities in LATAM, and stirring policy changes to support the development of our local communities.
