# Bienvenida

Historically, Latin America \(LATAM\) has produced many musics that have resonated around the world. Equally, it has also significantly contributed and continues to con-tribute to the field of New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) \[1\]. Yet, the NIME conference has only been hosted in LATAM once in 2019 at Porto Alegre, Brazil, where only 18 publications out of 88 were from LATAM authors and co-authors \[2\], and authors affiliated to LATAM institutions

1 represent only 2.4% of the total amount of participants of the first 20 NIME Conference editions \(from 2001 to 2020\) \[3\]. 

In this workshop we aim to discuss ways of further visibilizing and fostering NIME research in, by and for LATAM, echoing recent efforts from the wider LATAM Human-Computer Interaction research community \[4\]. Moreover, we primarily expect to consolidate a LATAM NIME Research Community through a series of actionable initiatives, such as creating a LATAM NIME network, and exploring ways of makingNIME research more accessible, affordable and resourceful in consideration of regional geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges, among other actions.

We propose a Latin American \(LATAM\) New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) Research Community. We aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-term actionable initiatives that a LATAM NIME Research Community could explore in the near future.

We look forward to taking the first steps towards a LATAM NIMECommunity and the future of this community within and beyond NIME, opening to other communities in LATAM, and stirring policy changes to support the development of our local communities.
