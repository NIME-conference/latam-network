# Welcome

Historically, Latin America \(LATAM\) has produced many musics that have resonated around the world. Equally, it has also significantly contributed and continues to con-tribute to the field of New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) \[1\]. Yet, the NIME conference has only been hosted in LATAM once in 2019 at Porto Alegre, Brazil, where only 18 publications out of 88 were from LATAM authors and co-authors \[2\], and authors affiliated to LATAM institutions represent only 2.4% of the total amount of participants of the first 20 NIME Conference editions \(from 2001 to 2020\) \[3\]. 

In this workshop we aim to discuss ways of further visibilizing and fostering NIME research in, by and for LATAM, echoing recent efforts from the wider LATAM Human-Computer Interaction research community \[4\]. Moreover, we primarily expect to consolidate a LATAM NIME Research Community through a series of actionable initiatives, such as creating a LATAM NIME network, and exploring ways of making NIME research more accessible, affordable and resourceful in consideration of regional geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges, among other actions.

We propose a Latin American \(LATAM\) New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) Research Community. We aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-term actionable initiatives that a LATAM NIME Research Community could explore in the near future.

* Communication platforms for the community \(such as a mailing list, a Discord/Slack Workspace, a Telegram/WhatsApp group, a Forum, etc.\)
* Define what can be hosted in the subdomain: latam.nime.org \(such as repositories for NIME related projects, biographies of the members, a blog, tutorials, interviews, etc.\)
* Regular events that can gather locally or remotely the community \(such as a local NIME conference chapter, regular meetings, festivals, conferences, residencies, etc.\)
* Creating a local NIME-related publication \(such as a journal, magazine, conference proceedings, etc.\)
* Creative projects to foster a LATAM NIME Community \(such as creating virtual space for meeting and sharing our contents, original artworks, apps, or platforms to connect the members of the community in different ways, etc.\)

We look forward to taking the first steps towards a LATAM NIMECommunity and the future of this community within and beyond NIME, opening to other communities in LATAM, and stirring policy changes to support the development of our local communities.
