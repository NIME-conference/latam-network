The Latin American NIME Research Network aims to provide a space to share resources, tutorials, and repositories from members of the community, as well as to showcase their works. We also look forward to organising meet ups and events which we will share in this webpage and our communication platforms (please contact the administrators to gain access to these platforms).  

With this network we also aim to take the first steps towards a LATAM NIME Community and the future of this community within and beyond NIME, opening to other communities in LATAM, and stirring policy changes to support the development of our local communities.
