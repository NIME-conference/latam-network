# Welcome

Historically, Latin America \(LATAM\) has produced manymusics that have resonated around the world. Equally, ithas also significantly contributed and continues to con-tribute to the field of New Interfaces for Musical Expres-sion \(NIME\) \[1\]. Yet, the NIME conference has only beenhosted in LATAM once in 2019 at Porto Alegre, Brazil,where only 18 publications out of 88 were from LATAMauthors and co-authors \[2\], and authors affiliated to Latin

American institutions1represent only 2.4% of the totalamount of participants of the first 20 NIME Conferenceeditions \(from 2001 to 2020\) \[3\]. In this workshop weaim to discuss ways of further visibilizing and fosteringNIME research in, by and for LATAM, echoing recent ef-forts from the wider LATAM Human-Computer Interac-tion research community \[4\]. Moreover, we primarily ex-pect to consolidate a LATAM NIME Research Communitythrough a series of actionable initiatives, such as creatinga LATAM NIME network, and exploring ways of makingNIME research more accessible, affordable and resource-ful in consideration of regional geopolitical and socioeco-nomic challenges, among other actions.

We propose a Latin American \(LATAM\) New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) Research Community. We aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-term actionable initiatives that a LATAM NIME Research Community could explore in the near future.

Communication platforms for the community \(such asa mailing list, a Discord/Slack Workspace, a Tele-gram/WhatsApp group, a Forum, etc.\)• Define what can be hosted in the subdomainlatam.nime.org \(such as repositories for NIME re-lated projects, biographies of the members, a blog,tutorials, interviews, etc.\)• Regular events that can gather locally or remotely thecommunity \(such as a local NIME conference chap-ter, regular meetings, festivals, conferences, residencies,etc.\)• Creating a local NIME-related publication \(such as ajournal, magazine, conference proceedings, etc.\)• Creative projects to foster a LATAM NIME Commu-nity \(such as creating virtual space for meeting and shar-ing our contents, original artworks, apps, or platformsto connect the members of the community in differentways, etc.\)

We lookforward to taking the first steps towards a LATAM NIMECommunity and the future of this community within andbeyond NIME, opening to other communities in LATAM,and stirring policy changes to support the development ofour local communities.
