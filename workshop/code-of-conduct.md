# Code of Conduct

We aim to have an inclusive, respectful and productive workshop, in which we generate many useful ideas. To achieve this we ask you to**:**

* Use an appropriate username so that we can identify you by your name \(Please avoid alias or nicknames like 'Tiger123'\).
* Raise your hand and respect peopleâ€™s turns to speak.
* Mute your microphone unless it is your turn to speak to avoid noise.
* When your camera is on, make sure you are facing the camera, visible, with good lightning and background.
* Avoid using offensive language. Any kind of harassment, bullying or hateful speech will not be tolerated.
