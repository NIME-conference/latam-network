# Discussion Topics



We propose a LATAM NIME Research Network, with which we aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-termed actionable initiatives that the network and the community could explore in the near future. Some of these actions include:

* Establishing a LATAM NIME Network by: 
  * Building stronger ties through multiple communication platforms \(e.g., a mailing list, a Discord Server, a Slack Workspace, a Telegram/WhatsApp group, a wiki, a forum, etc.\)
  * 
* Define what can be hosted in the subdomain: latam.nime.org \(such as repositories for NIME related projects, biographies of the members, a blog, tutorials, interviews with members, etc.\)
* Organise regular events that can gather locally or remotely the community \(such as a local NIME conference chapter, regular meetings, festivals, conferences, residencies, etc.\)
* Creating a local NIME-related publication \(such as a journal, magazine, conference proceedings, etc.\)
* Foster creative projects to visibilize the work of the LATAM NIME Community \(e.g., creating virtual space for meeting and sharing our contents, original artworks, apps, or platforms to connect the members of the community in different ways, etc.\)
