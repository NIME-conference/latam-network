## Towards a Latin American NIME Research Community

Historically, Latin America \(LATAM\) has produced many musics that have resonated around the world. Equally, it has also significantly contributed—and continues to contribute—to the field of New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\) \[1\]. Yet, the NIME conference has only been hosted in LATAM once at Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2019, where only 18 publications out of 88 were from LATAM authors and co-authors \[2\]. Furthermore, authors affiliated to LATAM institutions represent only 2.4% of the total amount of participants of the first 20 NIME Conference editions \(from 2001 to 2020\) \[3\]. 

In this workshop we aim to discuss ways of further visibilizing and fostering NIME research in, by and for LATAM, echoing recent efforts from the wider LATAM Human-Computer Interaction research community \[4\]. Moreover, we primarily expect to consolidate a LATAM NIME Research Community through a series of actionable initiatives, such as creating a LATAM NIME network, and exploring ways of making NIME research more accessible, affordable and resourceful in consideration of regional geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges, among other actions and topics of discussion.

We propose a LATAM NIME Research Network, with which we aim to start a discussion and generate ideas around short-termed actionable initiatives that the network and the community could explore in the near future. Some of these actions include:

* Establishing a LATAM NIME Network by: 
  * Building stronger ties through multiple communication platforms \(e.g., a mailing list, a Discord Server, a Slack Workspace, a Telegram/WhatsApp group, a wiki, a forum, etc.\)
  * 



* Define what can be hosted in the subdomain: latam.nime.org \(such as repositories for NIME related projects, biographies of the members, a blog, tutorials, interviews with members, etc.\)
* Organise regular events that can gather locally or remotely the community \(such as a local NIME conference chapter, regular meetings, festivals, conferences, residencies, etc.\)
* Creating a local NIME-related publication \(such as a journal, magazine, conference proceedings, etc.\)
* Foster creative projects to visibilize the work of the LATAM NIME Community \(e.g., creating virtual space for meeting and sharing our contents, original artworks, apps, or platforms to connect the members of the community in different ways, etc.\)
